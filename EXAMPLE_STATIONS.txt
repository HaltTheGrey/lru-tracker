# TIPS FOR SETTING MIN/MAX:
# 
# MIN (Restock Alert Level):
# - Set based on: How fast can you restock?
# - Higher min = more buffer, less stockouts
# - Lower min = tighter inventory, more restocks
#
# MAX (Pull System Trigger):
# - Set based on: Available space + safety stock
# - Higher max = more buffer, fewer pulls
# - Lower max = tighter control, more frequent pulls
#
# CURRENT (Starting Count):
# - Leave at 0 if doing first count later
# - Or set to actual current count for immediate tracking
#
# ADJUSTMENT TIPS:
# - Monitor trends for 1-2 weeks
# - Adjust min/max based on actual usage patterns
# - High-volume stations may need wider min/max spread
# - Low-volume stations can have tighter controls
