    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Windows protected your PC                      │
    │                                                  │
    │  Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an    │
    │  unrecognized app from starting. Running this   │
    │  app might put your PC at risk.                 │
    │                                                  │
    │  [More info]              [Don't run]           │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

This is NORMAL! Here's how to proceed safely:

STEP 1: Click "More info" (the small blue text link)

STEP 2: A new button appears - Click "Run anyway"

STEP 3: App opens normally!

✓ You only need to do this ONCE - Windows remembers your choice.
